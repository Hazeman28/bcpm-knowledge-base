# Contributing to these docs

If you want to contribute to these docs, then you can simply create a pull
requests in the repository (link on the top right in the navigation bar). But
before you start making any changes refer to guidelines below to help keep these
docs consistent.

## Use English

Although we are Slovak based company, we prefer to use English for communication
during development processes. These processes include *pull-requests* and
*code review*. And it is only natural to keep documentation in English as well.

## Check your grammar

Even if you are fluid in English, you still make grammar mistakes. So please,
before submitting your PR, run a spell check on your document and make sure that
everything is ok. You can even install spell checking extensions into your
editor. For instance, VSCode has an extension called [Code Spell Checker][0]
that highlights any misspells in your code, which includes markdown files.

## Wrap lines at column 80

Yes, you have to do that. This helps to keep my personal sanity at place and
makes these docs a place of order and comfort. Again, you don't have to do this
manually, any decent editor either has this type of functionality built-in, or
you can install and extension to add that functionality. In VSCode you can
install extension called [Rewrap][1] which does exactly that.

## Keep it short and concise

Whenever you are contributing to any type of documentation, you have to keep in
mind that it is developers just like you that are going to be reading it. So try
to keep information as concise as possible with as more practical, but don't
leave out any important details.

## List your sources

Always put a list of references at the end of a page. This acknowledges other
people's work and helps readers to more easily find links referenced in your
document.
